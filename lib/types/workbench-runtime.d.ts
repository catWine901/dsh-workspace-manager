 * registration, events, storage get/set, and a host call seam — and is
 * provided under {@link WORKBENCH_RUNTIME_SERVICE} by the manager fiber, so
 * disposer removal deletes the service and Cordis re-evaluates every dependent
 * wrapper fiber (provider loss parks them PENDING; re-provide reloads them).
 * Every registered side effect is owned by the runtime's fiber and released in
 * reverse mount order when the fiber unloads. The contract's client render
 * wiring lands with the fixture migration (M9); this host half records the
 * surface seat and its owning package provenance.
